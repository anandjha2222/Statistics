    "\n",
    "- In general, population is the practical concept, example being '10th standard student in india studying in public school'. However, somtimes population can be theoratical abstract concept, eaxmple being 'I created a new machine which produces some product and I am ineterested in the dimension of the product', but in this situation, I don't really have the actual product upfront. hence population here is just a concept. Now, you can produce some product and consider it as sample and go on with statistical analysis on that sample and make some inference about the 'conceptual population of products' as well as the machine"
